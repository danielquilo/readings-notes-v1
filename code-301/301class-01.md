[Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

# What is a “component”?

#### Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

# What are the characteristics of a component?

#### Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

## What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

#### The benefits are reduced development and testing time, enhanced reliability (because components are pre-tested), and the flexibility to change applications by adding or replacing components without major disruption

[What is Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child)


# What is “props” short for?

#### What are React props? In React, the term props stands for properties, which refers to the properties of an object. This is because all elements created in React are JavaScript objects. As a result, passing data into a component is done by creating properties and values for the object.

# How are props used in React?

#### Props are used to store data that can be accessed by the children of a React component. They are part of the concept of reusability. Props take the place of class attributes and allow you to create consistent interfaces across the component hierarchy.

# What is the flow of props?

#### We use props in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). Props is just a shorter way of saying properties. They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.
