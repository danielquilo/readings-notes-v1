# QUIZ

1. What are variables in JavaScript?
A- A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.

2. What does it mean to declare a variable?
A- Declaring a JavaScript Variable
You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword: var carName; or: let carName; After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined ).

3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?
A- Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

4. What is information received from the user called?
A- In JavaScript, we use the prompt() function to ask the user for input. As a parameter, we input the text we want to display to the user. Once the user presses “ok,” the input value is returned. We typically store user input in a variable so that we can use the information in our program.
