1. What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that describes how text should look on a page. HTML is another example of a markup language. Markdown is a style of writing documents that makes it easy to define what the content should look like. It describes headers, text styles, links, lists and so much more. 
Markdown is used in documentation, articles, and notes and can even be used to build a webpage.

2.What is the use of Markdown?

Markdown is device agnostic and displays the writing format consistently across device types.
