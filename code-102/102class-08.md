# What is an expression in JavaScript?
###### An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value. Conceptually, there are two types of expressions: those that assign a value to a variable, and those that simply have a value.

# Why would we use a loop in our code?

###### Programming Application: When programmers write code, loops allow them to shorten what could be hundreds of lines of code to just a few. This allows them to write the code once and repeat it as many times as needed, making it more likely for the program to run as expected.

# When does a for loop stop executing?

###### The for loop will step through each of the numbers in turn, performing the print action for each one. When the end of the range is reached, the for loop will exit.

# How many times will a while loop execute? 

###### The while() loop repeats as long as the condition is true (non-zero). If the condition is false the body of the loop never executes at all.
