1. What is the purpose of CSS? - CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

2. What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project? - There are three ways you can use to implement CSS into your HTML: internal, external, and inline styles.
 External CSS - A HTML file can be linked to a seperate .CSS document using <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /> or similar
 Internal CSS - CSS can be written within the HTML file itself using the <style> </style> element
 Inline CSS - CSS can be written within one line of the HTML file by defining an attribute e.g. style=color:red
