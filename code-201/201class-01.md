# What is an HTML attribute?

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag

# What is the Difference between # article # and # section # element tags?

The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

# What Elements does a “typical” website include?

- header: <header>
- navigation bar: <nav>
- main content: <main>, with various content subsections represented by <article>, <section>, and <div> elements.
- sidebar: <aside>; often placed inside <main>
- footer: <footer>

# How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

###### Meta tags are snippets of code that tell search engines important information about your web page, such as how they should display it in search results.

# How is the # meta # HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

###### <meta attribute="value">

or

<meta attribute="value" attribute="value, value, value">

# What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

# Semantics.

# Why should you use an <h1> element over a <span> element to display a top level heading?

###### <h1> produces a top level heading.

By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an h1 with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).

On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top level heading. Consider the following:

<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">Not a top-level heading!</span>

This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

# What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

[What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

# How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?

###### JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses elements to apply external stylesheets and <style> elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the <script> element
