# CSS Layout


# [Learn CSS - Flexbox](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

# Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
 
 ###### Being one-dimensional, it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time.

# Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

###### The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.

# How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
 
 ###### A design pattern that can be tricky in responsive design is a sidebar that sits inline with some content. Where there is viewport space, this pattern works great, but where space is condensed, that rigid layout can become problematic.

# What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

###### For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.

### The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:

### Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
### Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
### Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
### As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!

###### It is a great tool to style your HTML code.
