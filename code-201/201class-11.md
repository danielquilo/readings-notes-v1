# Class 11 - Audio and Video in HTML; Domain Modeling Revisited

### Readings: Audio, Video, Images



[Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

# Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.


# Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.

###### The <video> HTML element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use <video> for audio content as well, but the <audio> element may provide a more appropriate user experience.[answer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)

# Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

###### To test the fallback content on browsers that support the element, you can replace <video> with a non-existing element like <notavideo>.

# Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.


[A Complete Guide To Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

# How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

###### The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. The two specifications share some common features, however, and if you have already learned how to use flexbox, the similarities should help you get to grips with Grid.

# Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

###### A grid container contains grid items. By default, a container has one grid item for each column, in each row, but you can style the grid items so that they will span multiple columns and/or rows.

[Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

# Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

###### Let's examine a typical scenario. A typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole of the width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column. Here's a simple example:[answer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

# Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

###### We can however use two attributes — srcset and sizes — to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. You can see an example of this in our responsive.html example on GitHub (see also the source code):

<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
         800px"
  src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

# How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

###### In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices. Responsive images are just one part of responsive design, a future CSS topic for you to learn.

Prerequisites:	You should already know the basics of HTML and how to add static images to a web page.
Objective:	Learn how to use features like srcset and the <picture> element to implement responsive image solutions on websites.
