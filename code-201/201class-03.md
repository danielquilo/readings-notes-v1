[Ordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and [Unordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) lists.


# When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
###### When marking up content which could be defined in some way as a list, you should consider using an unordered list ( <ul> ) for presentation. Not only does it improve the readability of your HTML code, it also applies meaning to content which would otherwise have none.

# How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
###### There are three properties you should know about to start with, which can be set on <ul> or <ol> elements: list-style-type : Sets the type of bullets to use for the list, for example, square or circle bullets for an unordered list, or numbers, letters, or roman numerals for an ordered list.

# When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
###### An unordered list ( <ul> ) is used to create a list of items in no particular order i.e. the order of items is not relevant. By default, the items in this list will be marked with bullets. Whereas, an ordered list ( <ol> ) is used to create a list of items in a specific order.

# Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
###### The HTML <ol> tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical.

[The Box Model.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

# Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
###### Padding represents the amount of inner space an element has, while the margin is whitespace available surrounding an element. It's not possible to set padding to auto padding. However, you can use automatic settings for margins. It's not possible to use negative values when defining padding, but you can with margins.

# List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
###### Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.
