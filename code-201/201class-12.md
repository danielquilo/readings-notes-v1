# Chart.js, Canvas

# [JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)

# What does the <canvas> allow a developer to acheive?

###### Canvas allows admins to create 2 types of developer keys: API keys and LTI keys. API keys allow external applications to act on behalf of an authenticated Canvas user.

# What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?

###### The HTML <canvas> tag is used for dynamically creating graphics. This is done in conjunction with a script (usually a JavaScript). For example, it can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, photo compositions, and even animations.

# Explain what the getContext() method does.

###### The HTMLCanvasElement.getContext() method returns a drawing context on the canvas, or null if the context identifier is not supported, or the canvas has already been set to a different context mode. Later calls to this method on the same canvas element, with the same contextType argument, will always return the same drawing context instance as was returned the first time the method was invoked. It is not possible to get a different drawing context object on a given canvas element.

# What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

###### While charts may sacrifice some precision and granularity, they allow for a broader scope of high-level analysis and quicker comprehension of the data. By simplifying complex datasets and highlighting distributions, trends, and numerical patterns, charts visually present your data, making it easier to understand.
