- Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

###### The semantic HTML tags help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of web pages. The pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read. It has greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience.

- How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

###### HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.

- What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?

###### The <sub> HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.

###### The <sup> HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text

- When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

###### The <abbr> HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.

When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.

The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.

# Learn CSS

[How CSS Is Structured.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_is_structured)

# What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

###### Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.

###### Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.

###### External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

# Why should we avoid using inline styles?

###### Disadvantages of Inline CSS:

Adding CSS rules to each HTML element takes time and makes your HTML structure unorganized. It's difficult to keep up, reuse, and scale.
The size and download time of your page can be affected by styling multiple elements.
Inline styles cannot be used to style pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. For example, you can style the visited, hover, active, and link colors of an anchor tag using external and internal style sheets.

# Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

# What is representing the selector?

###### CSS selectors define the pattern to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then applied.

###### CSS selectors can be grouped into the following categories based on the type of elements they can select.

# Which components are the CSS declarations?

###### Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. A property and value pair is called a declaration, and any CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out, and to style it.Both properties and values are case-insensitive by default in CSS. The pair is separated by a colon, ':' (U+003A COLON), and white spaces before, between, and after properties and values, but not necessarily inside, are ignored.

<img scr="image/css declaration 201-class02" alt="declaration">

###### There are more than 100 different properties in CSS and a nearly infinite number of different values. Not all pairs of properties and values are allowed and each property defines what are the valid values. When a value is not valid for a given property, the declaration is deemed invalid and is wholly ignored by the CSS engine.

# Which components are considered properties?

h2 {
color: black;
padding: 5px;
}

# What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

###### The text data type is called string, because text is a string, or sequence, of characters. In Python, strings are always enclosed in quotations marks, like this: 'Cat' , or this "Cat" .

# List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

###### Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

###### Arithmetic operators

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/). These operators work as they do in most other programming languages when used with floating point numbers (in particular, note that division by zero produces Infinity). For example:

1 / 2; // 0.5
1 / 2 === 1.0 / 2.0; // this is true
Copy to ClipboardCopy to Clipboard
In addition to the standard arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /), JavaScript provides the arithmetic operators listed in the following table:

###### String operators

In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.

For example,
console.log("my " + "string"); // console logs the string "my string".
The shorthand assignment operator += can also be used to concatenate strings.

For example,
let mystring = "alpha";
mystring += "bet"; // evaluates to "alphabet" and assigns this value to mystring.

###### Comma operator

The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop. It is regarded bad style to use it elsewhere, when it is not necessary. Often two separate statements can and should be used instead.

For example, if a is a 2-dimensional array with 10 elements on a side, the following code uses the comma operator to update two variables at once. The code prints the values of the diagonal elements in the array:

const x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const a = [x, x, x, x, x];

for (let i = 0, j = 9; i <= j; i++, j--) {
// ^
console.log(`a[${i}][${j}]= ${a[i][j]}`);
}

# Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

###### For example: greeting('Jenny'); //Output // Hello Jenny ! The argument is the value Jenny and you can think of it as name = 'Jenny' . name , the parameter, is the placeholder variable, and Jenny is the value you pass in when you call the function.

# [Making Decisions In Your Code – Conditionals.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)

# An if statement checks a ** and if it evaluates to \_**, then the code block will execute.

# What is the use of an else if?

###### Conditional Statements

###### Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

###### You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

###### In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

###### Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

###### Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false

###### Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

###### Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

# List 3 different types of comparison operators.

###### The < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal), and >= (greater than or equal) comparison, also known as relational, operators compare their operands.

# What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

###### The && and || Operators in JavaScript. If applied to boolean values, the && operator only returns true when both of its operands are true (and false in all other cases), while the || operator only returns false when both of its operands are false (and true in all other cases)
