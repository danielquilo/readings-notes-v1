[Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

# To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

###### A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address

# The href attribute contains what information?

###### The HREF is an attribute of the anchor tag, which is also used to identify sections within a document. The HREF contains two components: the URL, which is the actual link, and the clickable text that appears on the page, called the "anchor text."

# What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

###### An accessible link text is a text that makes sense without any context. A link text should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link.

[CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)


# What is meant by “normal flow”?

###### Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout. Once something is taken out of flow it works independently.

# What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

###### Difference Between Inline and Block Elements in HTML
Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.

# ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

###### Static positioning is the default that every element gets.

# Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

###### Aside from a few IE bugs, very good cross-browser support.
###### Less dependence on floats, which can be problematic.
###### Less dependence on margins, which can be a bit buggy in older IE.

# What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

###### Absolutely positioned elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

# Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

###### declaration The term declaration means to declare the creation of variables and functions

* Example 1
* var color;
###### The code above is a declaration of a JavaScript var variable named color. Note: Declaration is not concerned with the storage (initialization) of values. Instead, its job is to declare the creation of variables and functions.

# What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

###### Note the difference between parameters and arguments: Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied
